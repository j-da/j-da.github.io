*This month,* with the end of my time in Hong Kong fast approaching, there's a lot for me to reflect on and be grateful for.

Firstly, if you've not yet seen the incredible video for Childish Gambino's [This is America](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYOjWnS4cMY), I implore you to watch it. Whether he was being truthful or tactful at the MET Gala (stating that he "honestly just wanted to make a good song"), it is a greatly powerful piece of media. Along similar themes, Joyner Lucas' [I'm Not Racist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43gm3CJePn0) explores the deep divisions in our society, and reflecting on these I am especially grateful for the opportunities that have been afforded to me and how privileged I am.

That privilege extends to having met two people I'm grateful to know this month,
[Dekai Wu](http://www.cs.ust.hk/~dekai/) and [Peter Dingle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/petermdingle/), who have both given me great perspectives on enterpreneurship and have inspired greater confidence and some direction in where I hope to go in the near future. My special thanks to Peter for inviting me to accompany him on Wednesday for a great insight into FinTech's present and future.

With final exams quick approaching I look forward to having some more time afterwards to explore more of what I've learnt this year&mdash;about machine learning in particular&mdash;and to work on some more personal projects. I'm also very excited about returning to University of Bristol's SCEEM Outreach programme, which I have missed this year; not only is creating opportunities for children to persue their curiosity about computer science and electronics greatly important if we are to see greater diversity and creativity in the fields going forward, but it's also so enjoyable to work on and deliver the outreach activities.
