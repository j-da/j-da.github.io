    <h2>No rockets, no fantasies.<br/>
        Just healthy curiosity<br/>and a code editor.</h2>

    <p>As well as being a <strong>Computer Science student at the University of Bristol</strong>,
        I spend my spare time creating <strong>websites and apps</strong> and going into schools
        and youth groups as a <strong>STEM Ambassador</strong>.
        Ever inquisitive, I started coding BASIC on an Acorn Electron aged 9, and moved on to
        <strong>C#, C/C++, Java and NodeJS (amongst others)</strong>.
        I now <strong>develop for the web, for server-side and for Android.</strong></p>

    <p>I'm ready for a new challenge.
